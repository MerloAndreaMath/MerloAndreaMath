        <h2>Detailed Summary: Geometry of 1-Codimensional Measures in Heisenberg Groups</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The study of rectifiability in Euclidean spaces has been a cornerstone of geometric measure theory, with profound implications for understanding the structure of measures. A central result in this area is Preiss's rectifiability theorem, which connects the density properties of a Radon measure with its rectifiability. Specifically, for a measure in \( \mathbb{R}^n \), if the (integer-dimensional) density exists and is finite, the measure is rectifiable—i.e., it can be represented as a countable union of Lipschitz images of Euclidean subsets, up to a negligible set. This provides a deep insight into how local geometric properties determine global structure.</p>
        
        <p>Extending such ideas to non-Euclidean spaces, particularly the Heisenberg group \( \mathbb{H}^n \), has posed significant challenges. The Heisenberg group is a fundamental example of a sub-Riemannian manifold and exhibits a Carnot-Carathéodory geometry, where distances are defined through horizontal vector fields rather than the standard Euclidean metric. Despite being topologically equivalent to \( \mathbb{R}^{2n+1} \), its metric properties differ drastically, particularly in terms of rectifiability and dimension theory.</p>
        
        <p>The Heisenberg group has a Hausdorff dimension of \( 2n+2 \) (with respect to the Carnot-Carathéodory metric), and a striking feature is that many subsets, such as those that are Lipschitz images of Euclidean spaces, are purely unrectifiable in certain dimensions. For instance, 1-dimensional Lipschitz images have zero 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure in \( \mathbb{H}^n \). These peculiarities make it essential to rethink and adapt classical notions of rectifiability and tangent measures to the Heisenberg setting.</p>
        
        <p>In this paper, we investigate the geometry of 1-codimensional measures in \( \mathbb{H}^n \). Specifically, we focus on measures with (integer-dimensional) density equal to \( 2n+1 \), a natural counterpart to the co-dimension 1 setting in Euclidean spaces. Our goal is to understand the structure of these measures by examining their tangents, classifying uniform measures, and exploring their geometric regularity. The results not only generalize known theorems but also highlight phenomena unique to the Heisenberg group, shedding light on how its sub-Riemannian geometry influences the behavior of measures.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Results</h3>
        <h4>Flat Tangents for (2n+1)-Density Measures</h4>
        <p>A cornerstone of our analysis is the result that measures in \( \mathbb{H}^n \) with density \( 2n+1 \) (relative to the Hausdorff measure) exhibit only flat tangents. This means that at almost every point, the tangent measure is equivalent to the (2n+1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to a homogeneous subgroup of \( \mathbb{H}^n \). This extends the classical Euclidean notion of flatness, where tangent measures correspond to Lebesgue measures on subspaces, to the Heisenberg setting, where flatness aligns with the intrinsic geometry of the group.</p>
        
        <p>The proof relies on analyzing the structure of measures at small scales, leveraging the regularity implied by the density condition. By examining blow-ups of the measure, we show that the local geometry converges to a homogeneous subgroup. This result bridges the gap between density conditions and geometric regularity, providing a foundational step for further classification results.</p>
        
        <h4>Classification of Uniform Measures in \( \mathbb{H}^1 \)</h4>
        <p>In the first Heisenberg group \( \mathbb{H}^1 \), we complete the classification of uniform measures. Uniform measures are characterized by a constant density at almost every point, making them a natural analog to invariant measures in Euclidean spaces. Our classification reveals that such measures are closely tied to specific homogeneous subgroups, reflecting the stratified structure of \( \mathbb{H}^1 \).</p>
        
        <p>This classification not only extends earlier partial results but also provides a template for studying uniform measures in higher-dimensional Heisenberg groups. By linking uniformity to subgroup structures, our results emphasize the interplay between algebraic and geometric properties in the Heisenberg setting.</p>
        
        <h3>Implications and Future Directions</h3>
        <p>Our findings have several implications for the broader study of rectifiability and geometric analysis in sub-Riemannian spaces. The connection between density, tangents, and flatness highlights the robustness of these concepts across different geometric settings. Moreover, the classification of uniform measures opens the door to further investigations into the finer properties of measures in \( \mathbb{H}^n \), such as their uniqueness, stability, and interactions with intrinsic rectifiable sets.</p>
        
        <p>Future work could explore higher co-dimensions, the role of non-homogeneous measures, and extensions to other Carnot groups. These directions promise to deepen our understanding of geometric measure theory in non-Euclidean contexts, with potential applications to harmonic analysis, geometric group theory, and beyond.</p>
